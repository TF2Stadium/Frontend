  <h1>TF2Stadium Rules</h1>

  <h3>TL;DR: DON’T BE A JERK</h3>

  <p>Below you will find a concise list of rules designed to help
    explain what we allow on our site. Unfortunately, no set of rules
    could cover all future possibilities, so we expect you to use your
    common sense and follow the spirit of the rules.</p>

  <p>If you have a question about one of these rules or have doubts
    about something you want to do, please post on
    our <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/TF2Stadium"

    clarification.</p>

  <p>All rule violations are handled on a case-by-case basis. For
    information about how we handle site violations and how to appeal a
    punishment, please refer to the
    <a href="/rules/punishments">Punishments Page</a>.</p>

  </ol>

  <h2>Chat Etiquette</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Do not spam.</b>
      <p>On-site chat is not the place to paste your
        &ldquo;copy-pasta&rdquo; or post ascii images.</p></li>

    <li><b>Use English.</b>
      <p>Unfortunately, it would put an incredible burden on our staff
        to moderate chat and issues in languages other than
        English.</p></li>

    <li><b>Avoid these topics</b>
      <p> While we are strong proponents of free speech, unfortunately
        there are some topics we have to restrict to keep the experience
        great for all of our users. We will only add items if they become
        serious problems:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Arguing with staff about site bans or rules. Please use
          the appropriate sections in the forums instead.</li>
        <li>Soliciting trades. This is not a trading site. Instead,
          please use one of the several trading sites available to the
          community.</li>
        <li>Encouraging other users to break a site rule.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li><b>Do not encourage or discuss illegal activities.</b>
      <p>Please comply with US, UK, and EU laws.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Lobby Leader Etiquette</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Do not abuse on-site kick/ban tools.</b>
        <p>Our site is for the enjoyment of all of its members, and
          the usage of lobby kick/bans to harass a user is
          unacceptable. Banning someone from your lobby should be
          considered a serious action and should not be done without a
          reason.</p>

        <p>An example of a valid kick/ban would be to remove someone who
          trolls you repeatedly.</p>

        <p>An example of an invalid kick/ban would be to remove someone
          because you do not believe they are good enough. Instead use the
          lobby slot restriction tools available to you.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Server admin abuse is not allowed.</b>
        <p>Abuse includes, but is not limited to, kicking a player from
          the server, enabling sv_cheats, or otherwise changing expected
          competitive gameplay.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Make sure your server is adequate.</b>
        <p>Have the appropriate configurations and whitelists. Disable
        any gameplay changing server mods. Do not use a server hosted
        on your own computer.</p>
        <p>For more information on preferable server configurations,
        read the <a href="#" ui-sref="about-servers">About Servers</a> page.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
