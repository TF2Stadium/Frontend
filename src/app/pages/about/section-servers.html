  <h1>Servers</h1>

  <p>Servers used for lobbies do not necessarily require any plugins
  (except for bball.tf requiring SourceMod), but the following plugins
  will help provide a much better experience for everyone playing on
  your server:

  <h2>Server Mods</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://tftrue.esport-tools.net/" target="_blank">TFTrue</a>:
      When present, we use this server plugin in order to
    automatically configure the server's whitelist
    using <a href="http://whitelist.tf" target="_blank">whitelist.tf</a>.

    <li><a href="https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Installing_SourceMod_(simple)"
    target="_blank">SourceMod</a>: Allows for other addons, and is
    need for the bball.tf config (which uses sm_cvar to set
    spec_freeze_time 0).

    <li><a href="https://github.com/TF2Stadium/stadium-sm-plugin/raw/master/teams.smx" target="_blank">SM Teams Plugin</a>:
      When present, we use this SourceMod plugin in order to
    automatically assign people to their proper team and class, and to
    sync their in-game name with their TF2Stadium alias.
  </ul>

  <h2>serveme.tf</h2>

  <p>Servers from <a href="http://serveme.tf/" target="_blank">serveme.tf</a>
    may be used, but note that the lobby will be automatically closed
    if the reservation ends. This can happen if the reservation ends
    before the current lobby is finished, or if the server is idle for
    too long (for example, while waiting for players to join the lobby).
