  <h1>TF2Stadium Mission Statement</h1>

  <p>Our mission is to provide a place for players of all skill levels to
  play competitive TF2 and to offer a welcoming place of learning for
  those new to the community.</p>

  <p>This organisation aims to be as transparent and democratic as
  possible in its operations. Therefore all code shall be open source,
  freely available in public and the site and slack will remain free
  of charge for all users aside from strictly non-essential donator
    perks.</p>
